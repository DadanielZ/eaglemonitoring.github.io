* Test policy and check alerting

    **Example 1** (HDFSAuditLog): validate sample policy “viewPrivate” on [Eagle web](http://localhost:9099/eagle-service) by running a HDFS command

      $ hdfs dfs -cat /tmp/private

    You should see an alert for policy name “viewPrivate” in [Eagle web](http://localhost:9099/eagle-service) . Under Alerts page.

    **Example 2** (HiveQueryLog): validate sample policy “queryPhoneNumber” in [Eagle web](http://localhost:9099/eagle-service) by submitting a hive job

      $ su hive
      $ hive
      > set hive.execution.engine=mr;
      > use xademo;
      > select a.phone_number from customer_details a, call_detail_records b where a.phone_number=b.phone_number;

  You should see an alert for policy name “queryPhoneNumber” in [Eagle web](http://localhost:9099/eagle-service) . Under Alerts page.
